## Comparing strings - use of relational operators like >, >=, <, <=, ==, !=  
# returns Boolean value : True or False 

s1='Box'
s2='Boy'
if(s1==s2):         # checks values 
    print('Both are same')
else:
    print('Not same')
    
#Not same


if s1 < s2:         # checks alphabetically which string comes first n which one next
    print('s1 is less than s2')
else:
    print('s1 is greater than or equal to s2')
